# Pneumonia_detection_proj
focuses on developing technologies to assist hospitals in diagnosing patients, particularly children. A dataset containing 5856 chest X-ray images from children, split between a training dataset and a test dataset. Each image has a label that specifies if the X-ray corresponds to a patient with pneumonia or one without it.
